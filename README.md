## Overview

> ⚠️ School project for the course Security ⚠️ 

The Goal of this project is to make a Spy Pixel that can be send through email and track the user that opens the email. The Spy Pixel is a small image that is invisible to the user. When the user opens the email the image will be loaded from the server and the server will log the IP address of the user. The Spy Pixel can be used to track the user and to see if the user has opened the email.
